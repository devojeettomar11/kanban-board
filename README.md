# kanban-boardThis Dynamic Kanban Board app enables users to create tasks via a simple form with a title and description. Tasks are added to the To Do column and can be dragged and dropped between To Do, In Progress, and Done columns. The app uses localStorage to persist tasks across page reloads. The code is designed in a modular structure, separating concerns into distinct modules for storage management, DOM utilities, drag-and-drop logic, and main application flow. At least one reusable utility function (for DOM element creation) is implemented to improve maintainability. Clear comments, meaningful variable names, and proper indentation ensure readability, while modularity enables scalability for future feature extensions without major rewrites.
